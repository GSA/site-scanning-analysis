To grow, an ecosystem's plants   use sunlight, atmospheric carbon dioxide and the moisture available to their roots. They also release some carbon   dioxide back into the atmosphere.

Flying on a Gulfstream-III (G-III) aircraft, AirMOSS will use   radar to collect soil moisture data from nine climatic habitats in North America to estimate how much carbon the   continent is taking in or releasing to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide has an important influence on climate, and the   AirMOSS results will help to improve the accuracy of climate projections for the next 50-100 years.
