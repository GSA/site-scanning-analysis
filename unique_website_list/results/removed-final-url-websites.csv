The primary purpose of the Refuge is to provide habitat for waterfowl, migratory birds, and other wildlife.

During this time he was sought by Canadian authorities and was the subject of an INTERPOL Red Notice. Boulachanis remained out of sight for years until Canada’s INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Ottawa asked INTERPOL Washington to assist in the cold fugitive case because of new leads developed in Quebec. To break this case, investigators in Canada and the United States shared and disseminated lead information between the two INTERPOL NCBs, and used all resources available to Canadian and U.S. investigators in a concerted effort to locate and apprehend Boulachanis. For the United States, INTERPOL Washington served as a centralized information repository in the effort to assist Canadian law enforcement with the location and capture of the fugitive in June 2011. INTERPOL Washington reviewed historical records and conducted analysis related to the fugitive and his aliases and collected information from U.S. law enforcement agencies which assisted in Boulachanis’ apprehension in Canada. The apprehension of Boulachanis was the result of outstanding cooperation and collaboration by INTERPOL Washington; the U.S. Marshals Service; the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office (Florida); the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office (Virginia); Surete du Quebec – Canada, Major Crimes Unit; and INTERPOL Ottawa. A component of the U.S. Department of Justice, INTERPOL Washington is co-managed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. As the designated representative to INTERPOL on behalf of the Attorney General, INTERPOL Washington serves as the national point of contact for all INTERPOL matters, coordinating international investigative efforts among member countries and the more than 18,000 local, state, federal, and tribal law enforcement agencies in the United States.",True,https://www.justice.gov/interpol-washington/robots.txt,False,False,True,404.0,text/html,,,,https://www.justice.gov/interpol-washington/sitemap.xml,False,False,True,404.0,text/html,,,,"[""8906.global.siteimproveanalytics.io"",""bam.nr-data.net"",""cdn.jsdelivr.net"",""dap.digitalgov.gov"",""fonts.googleapis.com"",""fonts.gstatic.com"",""js-agent.newrelic.com"",""polyfill.io"",""search.justice.gov"",""siteimproveanalytics.com"",""unpkg.com"",""www.google-analytics.com"",""www.youtube.com""]",13,,,True,"{""agency"":""DOJ"",""sp"":""find"",""yt"":""true""}"

Although Congress initially authorized $700 billion for TARP in October 2008, that authority was reduced to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Of that, the following amounts were committed through TARP's five program areas: Approximately $250 billion was committed in programs to stabilize banking institutions ($5 billion of which was ultimately cancelled). Approximately $27 billion was committed through programs to restart credit markets. Approximately $82 billion was committed to stabilize the U.S. auto industry ($2 billion of which was ultimately cancelled). Approximately $70 billion was committed to stabilize American International Group (AIG) ($2 billion of which was ultimately cancelled). Approximately $46 billion was committed for programs to help struggling families avoid foreclosure, with these expenditures being made over time. The authority to make new financial commitments under TARP ended on October 3, 2010. As of October 31, 2016, cumulative collections under TARP, together with Treasury's additional proceeds from the sale of non-TARP shares of AIG, exceed total disbursements by more than $7.9 billion. Treasury is now winding down its remaining TARP investments and is also continuing to implement TARP initiatives to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. TARP Programs Auto Industry TARP helped prevent the collapse of the American auto industry, saving more than a million American jobs. Bank Investment Programs TARP helped stabilize America's banking system during the financial crisis. Credit Market Programs TARP helped restart the secondary credit markets which are essential to keeping credit flowing to households and businesses. Executive Compensation Treasury issued standards governing executive compensation at financial institutions that received assistance under TARP. These standards are implemented and are overseen by the Office of the Special Master.​​​ Housing TARP helped prevent avoidable foreclosures and keeps families in their homes.

The ""Capital Movements"" tables of the Treasury Bulletin contain quarterly TIC data before the March 2014 issue. Articles on TIC.   Notices and Announcements NEW (4-28-2023). The Final Report on Foreign Portfolio Holdings of U.S. Securities at End-June 2022 is available from the SHL reports webpage (which is available from line 2 on the Securities(C) webpage (at line 2.c above)). Also available on that webpage is the Press Release, dated April 28, 2023, along with historical data and reports on previous surveys.   (NEW, 03-31-2023) Notice: Templates of new data files to be released on April 17, 2023 with data for February 2023, appear today on the Securities (A) and Securities (B) webpages. As explained in the notice dated 3-15-2023 (below), the changes are a result of new data from the expanded Form SLT and the discontinuation of the Form S reports. These reporting changes create a series break at February 2023 for all data on cross-border purchases and sales of long-term securities. (03-15-2023) Notice: The April 17 Release will begin new data on cross-border transactions in long-term securities (line 2.a above). The changes are related to the discontinuation of TIC Form S, “Purchases and Sales of Long-Term Securities by Foreign-Residents,” and the beginning of the revised and expanded TIC Form SLT, “Aggregate Holdings, Purchases and Sales, and Fair Value Changes of Long-Term Securities by U.S. and Foreign Residents.” There will be several important changes in the data. The new SLT-based data will be presented from the U.S. point of view, not from the foreign point of view of the S data. In addition, there will be an important change in the data on foreign securities -- U.S. purchases and sales of foreign securities for a given country will refer to securities issued by that country, in contrast to the current breakdown showing the amounts of all foreign securities bought and sold in each country, regardless of the country of issuance. Later this month, the TIC website will post templates of the new files that will be released on April 17. TIC reporting and file formats on banking claims and liabilities, derivatives, and claims and liabilities of nonfinancial firms remain unchanged.   (10-31-2022). The Final Report on U.S. Portfolio Holdings of Foreign Securities at End-year 2021 is available from the SHC reports webpage (which is available from line 1 on the Securities(C) webpage). Also available on that webpage is the Press Release, dated October 31, 2022, along with historical data and reports on previous surveys.   (12-30-2021). Nationality-based data are available from the Federal Reserve Board staff for 2003-2020. These FRB staff data are based on the nationality of the issuer of the foreign security; in contrast the TIC report on U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities is based on the residence of the issuer of the security. See section 1.a on the Securities(C) webpage. (line 2.c above)   (09-16-2021) Notice of a series break: This month’s data release includes significant revisions to holdings of long-term securities for June 2021. These revisions affect data on the Securities(B) webpage. (line 2.b above), including the table on major foreign holders of Treasury securities, and are described in footnote #5 on that webpage.   (08-16-2021). Data for 2020 on U.S. private holdings of foreign securities, by various subsectors of U.S. private holders and of foreign issuers are available in section 3 on the Securities(C) webpage. (line 2.c above).   (03-13-2021). The TIC Web site has been redesigned slightly and activated this past week. We invite users to inform us of any missing or broken links. -- Update your Bookmarks. If you use a bookmark in your browser to go to a certain webpage, you will open a redirect-page that says something like ""this page has been moved"". Clicking on the word ""moved"" will take you to the new webpage. Then you can change your bookmark to go to the new url location. -- The new webpages are exactly like the previous ones, except: (a) the text is larger so more scrolling will be required; and (b) the grey help-bar that was across the top of the old webpages has been renamed ""Contact TIC and Using TIC"", and moved into the left-hand column, under the section name ""Treasury International Capital (TIC) System Home Page"". On those webpages without a left-hand column, there is an equivalent button at the top of the page called ""Contact TIC & Using TIC"".   (06-25-2020). Data for 2018 and a Federal Reserve paper on Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) are available in section 4.a of the Securities(C) webpage (line 2.c above).   (5-16-2016). Country data now replace certain aggregates (such as oil exporters and Caribbean banking centers) previously used in data on holdings of Treasury securities. See section A.2.c on the Securities(b) webpage (line 2.b above). Also see the Press Release dated 05/16/2016.   (4-15-2015) Starting with the April 15, 2015 release of monthly TIC data, the tables have been adjusted to cover a larger number of countries for data beginning in January 2015.

Daily Treasury PAR Yield Curve Rates This par yield curve, which relates the par yield on a security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid prices on the most recently auctioned Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market. The par yields are derived from input market prices, which are indicative quotations obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at approximately 3:30 PM each business day. For information on how the Treasury’s yield curve is derived, visit our Treasury Yield Curve Methodology page. View the Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates   Daily Treasury PAR Real Yield Curve Rates The par real curve, which relates the par real yield on a Treasury Inflation Protected Security (TIPS) to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid prices on the most recently auctioned TIPS in the over-the-counter market. The par real yields are derived from input market prices, which are indicative quotations obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at approximately 3:30 PM each business day. Treasury began publishing this series on January 2, 2004. At that time Treasury released 1 year of historical data.

View the Daily Treasury Bill Rates   Daily Treasury Long-Term Rates and Extrapolation Factors Treasury ceased publication of the 30-year constant maturity series on February 18, 2002 and resumed that series on February 9, 2006. To estimate a 30-year rate during that time frame, this series includes the Treasury 20-year Constant Maturity rate and an ""adjustment factor,"" which may be added to the 20-year rate to estimate a 30-year rate during the period of time in which Treasury did not issue the 30-year bonds.

The Council is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and consists of 10 voting members and 5 nonvoting members, bringing together the expertise of federal financial regulators, state regulators, and an independent insurance expert appointed by the President. The Council brings together its members to assess, monitor, and mitigate risks to U.S. financial stability; improves communication with the public regarding these risks through reports and other publications; and facilitates cooperation and communication among member agencies on financial stability-related matters. The Council’s annual reports outline potential emerging threats and vulnerabilities, such as financial risks related to real estate, credit, and other markets; institutional risks associated with large bank holding companies and investment funds; risks related to the structure of Treasury markets and other financial markets; cybersecurity risks; and climate-related financial risks. In 2021, the Council identified three key priorities related to significant vulnerabilities in the financial system: nonbank financial intermediation, climate-related financial risk, and Treasury market resilience. In 2022, the Council identified a fourth key priority: risks related to digital assets. The Council has made considerable progress on each of these four priorities, as described below. Nonbank financial intermediation Nonbank financial institutions are an essential source of capital in financial markets and provide vital funding to the U.S. economy. While recognizing these benefits, the Council has identified certain vulnerabilities. The market dislocations of March 2020 further demonstrated that some nonbank financial institutions remain vulnerable and may amplify or transmit stress in the financial system. In 2021, the Council made it a priority to evaluate and address the risks to U.S. financial stability posed by three types of nonbank financial institutions: hedge funds, open-end mutual funds, and money market funds. Its progress on these efforts has included the reestablishment of the Council’s Hedge Fund Working Group, which has developed an interagency risk-monitoring framework to assess hedge fund-related risks to U.S. financial stability, and of the Nonbank Mortgage Servicing Task Force, as well as the creation of an Open-end Fund Working Group.   Climate-related financial risk The Council identified climate change as an emerging threat to U.S. financial stability in its Report on Climate-related Financial Risk , published in October 2021. The report identified ongoing activities at Council member agencies to understand and combat climate-related financial risk. It also provided concrete recommendations for member agencies to better assess climate-related financial stability risks, enhance climate-related disclosures, improve access to and the quality of climate-related financial data, and build capacity and expertise regarding climate-related financial risk. Since the publication of the report, the Council has made considerable progress in advancing the report’s recommendations. In addition to actions taken by individual member agencies, the Council created a staff-level Climate-related Financial Risk Committee, which has served as a forum for interagency information sharing and coordination in implementing the recommendations identified in the report. The Council also created an external advisory committee, the Climate-related Financial Risk Advisory Committee, which includes members from the financial services industry, non-governmental research institutions, data and analytics providers, nonprofit organizations, and academia to improve the Council’s understanding of the impact of climate change on the financial sector.   Treasury market resilience A deep and liquid Treasury market enables a strong U.S. economy and secure financial system, supports the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, and provides the benchmark for asset classes globally. The Council’s work to ensure the resiliency of the Treasury market includes its support for the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), which has outlined steps to improve U.S. Treasury market resilience, including enhancing data quality and availability; bolstering the resilience of market intermediation; evaluating expanded central clearing; and enhancing trading venue transparency and oversight. The Council supports the IAWG’s work through the Council’s Hedge Fund Working Group, which has reviewed the ways in which hedge fund liquidation of Treasury securities and Treasury derivatives at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to Treasury market volatility.   Digital assets The scale of crypto-asset activities has increased significantly in recent years. In October 2022, the Council published its Report on Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks and Regulation. The report reviews the financial stability risks and regulatory gaps posed by digital assets and provides recommendations to address such risks. The report concludes that crypto-asset activities could pose risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system if their interconnections with the traditional financial system or their overall scale were to grow without adherence to or the development of appropriate regulation, including enforcement of the existing regulatory structure.   To stay up to date on the work of the Council, you can sign up for e-mail updates.",False,https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/fsoc,False,True,True,200.0,text/html,,,,https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/fsoc,False,True,True,200.0,text/html,,,,"[""17de4c12.akstat.io"",""bam.nr-data.net"",""c.go-mpulse.net"",""dap.digitalgov.gov"",""fonts.googleapis.com"",""fonts.gstatic.com"",""js-agent.newrelic.com"",""s.go-mpulse.net"",""use.fontawesome.com"",""www.google-analytics.com"",""www.googletagmanager.com""]",11,,,True,"{""agency"":""TRE"",""pua"":""UA-19138737-19""}"
